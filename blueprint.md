# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a full-stack web application built with Laravel. It is designed to be developed within the Firebase Studio (formerly Project IDX) environment. The focus is on creating a fast, robust, and scalable application by leveraging Laravel's powerful features for routing, data handling, and backend logic.

## Implemented Features

*   **Homepage:** A visually appealing homepage with a hero section, a founder's message, and a signature block.
*   **Dashboard:** A modern, visually appealing dashboard with an animated welcome message, a navigation bar, a "Logout" button, and placeholders for a chart and data table.
*   **Login Page:** A modern login page with a clean and professional design.

## Current Plan

*   Create a visually appealing and informative dashboard page.

## Steps

1.  Create the `resources/views/dashboard.blade.php` file.
2.  Update the `blueprint.md` file to reflect that the dashboard page has been created.
